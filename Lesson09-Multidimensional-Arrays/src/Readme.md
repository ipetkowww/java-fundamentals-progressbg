# Multidimensional Arrays Tasks

## Homework Tasks

***- Homework 01 -***<br> 
Write a Java program to add two matrices of the same size.<br>
Input:<br>
- Receive the number of rows from the console
- Receive the number of columns
- Populate the two matrices
- Create a new matrix that contains the sum of the two matrices (digits on each common index are summed up)

***- Homework 02 -***<br> 
Print a matrix based on following rules:
- Receive an int from the console and print a matrix with so many rows and columns.
- Use a method called printMatrix(int n)
- Use the Math.random() method to print a random number on each index.

***- Homework 03 -***<br> 
Switch rows and columns of a 2D array
- Write a program to receive and populate a 2D array from the console.
- Then, create a new 2D array that has the columns of the first array as rows, and the rows as columns.

***- Homework 04 -***<br> 
Finding the largest row in matrix
- Receive and populate a matrix from the console.
- Find the row, whose sum of number is the largest.
- Output the following: "Row 3 has the largest sum of numbers: 16"

***- Homework 05 -***<br> 
Finding the largest column in matrix
- Receive and populate a matrix from the console.
- Find the column, whose sum of number is the largest.
- Output the following: "Column 3 has the largest sum of numbers: 16"

***- Homework 06 -***<br> 
Place highest row in the beginning
- Find the row, whose sum of number is the largest.
- Reorder the rows in the original array such as the row with the highest sum to be the first (and the first will take its original place)

Example:<br>
Before: <br>
1 2 3 <br>
5 8 9 (highest)<br>
4 5 3<br>

After:<br>
5 8 9<br>
1 2 3<br>
4 5 3

***- Homework 07 -***<br> 
Place highest column in the beginning
- Find the column, whose sum of number is the largest.
- Reorder the columns in the original array such as the column with the highest sum to be the first (and the first will take its original place)

Example:<br>
Before: <br>
1 2 3 <br>
5 8 9 (highest)<br>
4 5 3<br>

After:<br>
3 8 1<br>
9 2 5<br>
3 5 4

***- Homework 08 -***<br> 
Print a non-squared matrix
- Two-dimensional arrays do not need to specify the length of the other dimensions.
- Write a program that receives the total rows of a 2D matrix.
- For each row, ask for the size of this row.
- Then, initialize this array and receive so many numbers to populate it.
- Print the result at the end.
