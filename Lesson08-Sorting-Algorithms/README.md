# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort
- This is one of the simplest sorting algorithms
- It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
- It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration.

⏲️ **Time complexity**: 
- worst case => O(n²) - quadratic
- best case  => O(n) - linear and it occurs if the list is already or almost sorted (2-3 items are at incorrect place).

## Selection Sort
- Used only for small arrays
- Find the min element in the array and then put it on the first position, then find the next min element and put it on the next position (index + 1). Repeat the flow until the array is sorted.

- worst case => O(n²) - quadratic
- best case  => O(n²) - quadratic
