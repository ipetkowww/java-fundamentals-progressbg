# Arrays Tasks

== Homework ==

***- Task 01 -***<br> 
Write a program to calculate the average of an array's values.<br>
Receive on the first line the size of the array: "Enter size of the array: " <br>
Receive then the specified values: "Enter number: " <br>
Calculate the average as double and print the following output: "Average value of the array elements {print all elements} is : ... " <br>

***- Task 02 -***<br> 
Write a program to find the minimum and maximum member of an array values.
Receive on the first line the size of the array: "Enter size of the array: " <br>
Receive then the specified values: "Enter number: " <br>
Find the minimum and maximum number and print the following output: "Input array: {print all elements}. Max element is {}. Min element is {}"<br>

***- Task 05 -***<br> 
Read an array from console and then create a new array following these rules.<br>
- half of the element in the new array are same from the original array
- the other half of elements are the same elements but in reverse order<br>

***- Task 06 -***<br>
Read number from the console and then create an array with 10 elements foloowing these rules:<br>
- first two elements of the array are equal to the entered number from the console
- each following element of the array is equal to the sum of previous 2 elements in the array<br>

then print the elements of the array<br>
